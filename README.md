# ðŸš€ AWS Infrastructure Deployment with Terraform and Docker

This project showcases an end-to-end AWS deployment using **Terraform** to provision and configure cloud infrastructure. The goal is to simulate a real-world cloud engineer/devops workflow where infrastructure is deployed and managed as code (IaC), while maintaining modularity, scalability, and best practices.

## ðŸ§  Project Summary

This project provisions an **EC2 instance** using Terraform, which automatically pulls and runs a **Dockerized portfolio site** hosted on **Docker Hub**. Additional cloud resources like **CloudWatch** will be implemented to monitor the EC2 instance, following best practices around **IAM security**, modular code structure, and real-world deployment scenarios.
